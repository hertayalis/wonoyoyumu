Alongside his tag team partner Big Cass, he formed a bona fide merchandise seller, and Vince McMahon kept them on television for that reason. Despite their popularity, both Enzo and Cass were eventually released by the company after they broke up for totally different reasons. Amore also used to date Liv Morgan, and it seems Amore is proud of Morgan’s success in WWE.</p><p>It has been over four years since Enzo Amore was released by WWE due to allegations of sexual assault. Those allegations were deemed unfounded and no charges were ever filed. After his release, Amore occasionally competed on the independent circuit. In fact, he has been making big money&nbsp;<a href=#>in the independent scene</a>.</p><p>For those who are not aware, Enzo Amore started dating Liv Morgan while they were in NXT together. They were together for a while, but the two eventually split up.</p><p>While speaking on the&nbsp;<a href=#>Monte & The Pharaoh LI#1 Pro Wrestling Broadcast</a>, Enzo Amore talked about his ex-girlfriend Liv Morgan’s success in WWE. Amore made it clear that he is very proud of her.</p><p>“I hope that she pinches herself and knows that she did it. I’m proud of her. I’m happy for her. No ill will, vice versa. She’s a good human and she deserves it. I just think there’s a few things in life when you enter that world that hopefully you get. You get a WrestleMania and you get a title around your waist and you get to feel those things, and she’s done those things, so good for her.”&nbsp;</p><p>Enzo Amore also recently dropped a single that was about ‘<a href=#>Hacksaw’ Jim Duggan</a>. Enzo Amore also recently claimed that&nbsp;<a href=#>he would brutalize MJF on the microphone</a>&nbsp;in five minutes. We will have to wait and see what’s next in store for the former WWE Superstar.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>What do you think of Enzo Amore?
