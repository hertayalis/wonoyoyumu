The police publicly stated that they believed the couple had lied about the incident, with Lt Kenny Park saying: “Mr Quinn and Ms Huskins have plundered valuable resources away from our community, and have taken focus away from the true victims of our community while instilling fear amongst our community members.”&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: The new true-crime show is set to land on Netflix</figure><p id=ewYr_5pSRcD data-wc=62>However, after the real kidnapper, an ex-Marine named Matthew Muller, was eventually arrested and convicted, the couple filed a claim for violating their rights and destroying their reputations, with the claim reading: “While the Vallejo Police Department focused on two unsubstantiated theories, that Aaron killed Denise or that Denise somehow faked her own kidnapping, Denise endured unimaginable terror and a violent assault.”&nbsp;</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">TV shows we can't wait to watch in 2024</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/effbcff5d951-penelope-and-colin.jpg><ul><li>House of the Dragon - Sky/HBO</li><li>Miss Austen - BBC/Masterpiece</li><li>True Detective: Night Country - HBO/Sky</li><li>Masters of the Air - Apple TV+</li><li>The Night Manager season 2 - BBC&nbsp;</li><li>Daredevil: Born Again - Disney+</li><li>Bridgerton season 3 - Netflix</li><li>Wednesday season 2 - Netflix</li><li>Mr. and Mrs. Smith - Prime Video</li><li>3 Body Problem - Netflix</li><li>The Regime - HBO/Sky&nbsp;</li><li>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew - Jude Law - Disney+&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p id=edjPUHNGxIs data-wc=19>The couple settled for $2.5 million in 2018.

The pair tied the knot in 2018, with Denise sharing the gorgeous photos on Instagram, writing: “So grateful to my husband @movement_yoda and all of our loved ones for such an incredible day and wonderful memories. A special thanks to all of our vendors who helped make the day even more unforgettable: @monarchcoveinn for the breathtaking venue and attentive service.”&nbsp;</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=et1IOEaSLS66 data-wc=21>They also share two daughters, aged four and one.

It’s always terrifying putting ourselves out there, re-exposing ourselves publicly, but there is a greater purpose. Thank you for receiving this with such compassion and respect.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/54c901644d83-americannightmares1e100042916.png><p id=ebAiqMsea2P7 data-wc=39>Speaking about remaining together, they told Netflix: “I think we would have stayed together, and I think that’s why we were able to stay together. When you go through traumatic experiences, it does strip away some of the noise.&nbsp;</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=e8SX8IykR7y data-wc=65>"You start realising what’s really important: our relationship with each other, and our relationship with our families and close friends.

We have a solid bedrock, and places to go where people love us for who we are.”&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Netflix's Griselda: Where are Griselda Blanco's sons now?" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/8b4fca8144be-griselda-sofia-vergara.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Netflix's Griselda: Where are Griselda Blanco's sons now?" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Netflix's Griselda: Where are Griselda Blanco's sons now?</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="9 true crime shows that have reopened cases: from Mr Bates vs the Post Office to Unsolved Mysteries" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/955e60345346-mr-bates-court.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="9 true crime shows that have reopened cases: from Mr Bates vs the Post Office to Unsolved Mysteries" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>9 true crime shows that have reopened cases: from Mr Bates vs the Post Office to Unsolved Mysteries</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="The chilling true story behind ITV's Vanishing Act and Melissa Caddick's mysterious death" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/8c395999be97-vanishing-act-melissa.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="The chilling true story behind ITV's Vanishing Act and Melissa Caddick's mysterious death" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>The chilling true story behind ITV's Vanishing Act and Melissa Caddick's mysterious death</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=e7cmuFTIo98b data-wc=90>They added: “Despite all the crazy things that we’ve gone through, we are the lucky ones. That’s a major reason why we continue to put ourselves out there. We are the ones that had the ability to hire attorneys who stayed by our side to help ensure that we were protected as victims. We were fortunate to have an understanding of a system that’s really confusing in the first place. So now we can take that and use it to our advantage to reach as many other people as possible.”</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
