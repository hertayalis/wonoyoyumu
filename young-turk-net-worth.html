He was left to be raised by single mother together with his younger brother in the housing projects of Magnolia. He attended Fortier High School but eventually dropped out.</p><p>In 1996, Turk was discovered when he was jamming with some friends at a block party in his neighbourhood; Label owners and brothers Ronald and Bryan Williams heard him, and signed him to their record label Cash Money Records.</p><p>The following year, after multiple cameos in various videos, Turk together with young rappers B.G., Juvenile, and Lil’ Wayne, formed the group Hot Boys. The group released their first album in 1997 entitled “Get It How You Love” and followed by “Guerilla Warfare” in 1999 which achieved platinum status. Their third and last album – “Let ‘Em Burn” – was released in 2003, soon after which the group parted ways.

His shift in becoming a solo artist also helped in raising his wealth.</p><p>In 2005, Turk was sentenced to 10 years in prison after policed discovered that he was hiding a large numbers of weapons and a cache of drugs, but which was compounded by the shooting – later described as attempted murder – of a police officer, during a search of Turk’s apartment, for which conviction his time in prison was changed from 10 years to 14. However, after seven years he was released, but his time being incarcerated obviously effected his net worth tremendously.</p><p>While Turk was in prison, his producer Ke’Noe released some of his compositions in the form of two albums, “Still A Hot Boy” and “Convicted Felons”. After being released in 2012, Turk immediately went to work and released a single entitled “Zip It” with <a href=#>Lil Wayne</a>, so getting his net worth on the rise again.</p><p>Turk is getting back to the music scene slowly, and has released a mixtape under SoundCloud entitled “Blame It On the System”.</p><p>In his personal life, Young Turk is married to Erica Virgil, who underwent surgery for breast cancer in 2015, supported by donations from friends and fans.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=14.966545012165><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$50,000</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 8, 1981</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>New Orleans, Louisiana</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Rapper, vocalist</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Education</td><td>Fortier High School, Magnolia Projects, New Orleans</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Erica Virgil</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Gal Virgil, Tab Virgil Sr.</td></tr><tr readability=0.35897435897436><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/hotboyturk32</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.36734693877551><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/hotboyturk_32/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.23529411764706><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://imdb.com/name/nm4798719</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25396825396825><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.allmusic.com/artist/young-turk-mn0001315061</a></td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Record Labels</td><td>Laboratory, Cash Money Records, YNT Records, Rap-A-Lot Records, Universal Motown Records</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Albums</td><td>Young & Thuggin' (2001), Raw & Uncut (2003), Penitentiary Chances (2004), Still A Hot Boy (2005), Convicted Felons (2006), Blame It On The System (2013, Hip-hop/rap mixtape)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Music Groups</td><td>Cash Money Millionaires, Hot Boys</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>TV Shows</td><td>AudioThugography of Turk (CD), Make Love, Make Money (Reality show)</td></tr></table><h3>Known for movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjrKmrqaXYsG2vspmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
