No one is safe. Not the usual suspects (racial targets like Asians, African Americans, The Irish), nor innocent bystanders (pudgy Mexican horse caretakers, Icelandic folk, Sommeliers), which is fine, because&nbsp;the McDonaghs (both John Michael and his brother Martin) have a way of remaining&nbsp;acceptably entertaining in their sharp-tongued skewering. John Michael knows his cinematic strengths, so it’s no surprise that&nbsp;War On Everyone –&nbsp;aptly titled for its braggadocios’ ambition – doesn’t deviate from the McDonaghs’ highly entertaining, heroically off-color barrage of ef-you’s one iota. Better for us, worse for humanity.</span></p><p data-characters=633 data-current-count=633 data-injectable=true><span>Alexander Skarsgård&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>Michael Peña&nbsp;star as&nbsp;Terry Monroe&nbsp;and&nbsp;Bob Bolaño, two cops who not only ignore the rulebook but piss all over&nbsp;it, probably while crossing streams. Terry’s blatant alcoholism makes him a constant loose-cannon, while Bob talks his way through most confrontations, typically while poking fun at his target. During&nbsp;a routine “bust,” their intimidation tactics and loose morals lead them to&nbsp;a dangerous criminal, Lord James Mangan (Theo James), who proves to be their toughest mark. But Bob and Terry refuse defeat and come back swinging harder, and more reckless, than ever before.</span></span></p><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=319 data-injectable=false>Most provocatively, War On Everyone&nbsp;makes a statement against the larger police entity, as both Bob and Terry represent enforcers you love to hate (or just hate). Bob’s bribery tactics are off-the-charts greedy, while Terry’s drinking highlights societal generalizations that cops can get away with murder.</p><p data-characters=558 data-current-count=877 data-injectable=true>Furthermore, their boss, played by Paul Rieser, goes on to describe his&nbsp;precinct’s population&nbsp;as big, fat racist pigs of the Caucasian variety, which Bob experiences when he’s referred to as a Wetback. In a time when police sensitivity has reached its peak (hopefully), McDonagh not only confronts the beast head-on but embraces it, and somehow makes us root for overly sleazy, yet genuinely charming stereotypes who are more like vulgar Robin Hoods. They seem to only take advantage of those bad enough, so what’s there to disapprove of?</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false>It helps that War On Everyone is ferociously&nbsp;hilarious and aggressively outspoken, from an opening that asks (and answers) if a mime makes a sound when getting hit by a car, to Bob and Terry locating their country-jumping informant by standing still in Iceland&nbsp;(how long can it take to find a black man in Iceland?).</p><p data-characters=474 data-current-count=792 data-injectable=true>Bob and Terry’s comedy offends, harasses, and cares not about political correctness, but unlike Sacha Baron Cohen’s The Brothers Grimsby, insults are supplemented by cracking wit and poignant satire – not grotesque buffoonery. Consequences are ignored&nbsp;because both cops have abandoned civility,&nbsp;as Bob unsympathetically&nbsp;muses about happiness being a misleading chemical secretion. Just because we’re trained to be happy, doesn’t mean we are.</p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>These characters are self-centered go-getters, because nothing is a given. Why not have a little fun? Sure, Terry’s “Jihad” insult against some&nbsp;Hijab-wearing tennis players seems out-of-place, but&nbsp;McDonagh actually works to polish such material for proper insertion. You cringe, then you laugh, Cringe, then laugh. Rinse and repeat.</p><p data-characters=712 data-current-count=1064 data-injectable=true>Peña and&nbsp;Skarsgård are a comedic dream team, as their chemistry effortlessly weaves together absurd ideas and crass conflicts.&nbsp;Skarsgård’s inner pain feeds off of Bob’s boisterous attitude, one being the muscle, and the other acting as hype man. I’ll admit, I thought&nbsp;Peña would severely overshadow&nbsp;Skarsgård, but Terry’s constant intoxication makes for a deeply complex character whose biggest moments involve throwing one knockout punch (that thugs continually underestimate).&nbsp;Peña rattles off a billion and one jokes, all of which stick, as ghetto rap blaring themes of authority play over heated chases, to downplay any seriousness around two signature McDonagh characters.</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false>But, Peña was born to spout dickish comments followed by a coy, childish smile, while&nbsp;Skarsgård embraces his inner Mel Gibson, drunkenly beating his way through life’s toughest problems. These two were made for War On Everyone, as confirmed by a gut-busting highlight reel of biting hilarity.</p><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>Oh, and a quick shout-out to&nbsp;<span>Malcolm Barrett&nbsp;for keeping up with&nbsp;with&nbsp;Peña and&nbsp;Skarsgård’s performing stamina, and to&nbsp;<span>Caleb Landry Jones for his creepy, pale-faced second fiddle villain. Plus Tessa Thompson as&nbsp;Skarsgård’s sexily intimidating lover! High-fives, all.</span></span></p><p data-characters=815 data-current-count=815 data-injectable=true>Where the film falters, and not monumentally, is in structuring some type of overarching caper. Theo James does his part in playing a drug-loving adversary, complete with a shirtless decapitation&nbsp;scene, but motivations become murky as Bob and Terry press onward down a dangerous rabbit hole. The duo see&nbsp;Lord Mangan as a bad dude who needs dealing with, and go completely rogue to do so. Reiser’s authority at least acknowledges their random disappearances, especially Iceland, but sometimes we lose focus on why Mangan is even being pursued. McDonagh has a few scenes that get too preoccupied with shooting dagger-like insults in every foreseeable direction, and plotting does suffer in these moments (a John Woo shootout minus the doves?). But you’re still laughing, and that’s hard to forget.</p><p data-characters=693 data-current-count=693 data-injectable=true>Getting down to brass tacks, War On Everyone does exactly what it sets out to do –&nbsp;not give a single fuck. John Michael McDonagh’s wheelhouse is squeezing laughter out of the most inappropriate moments,&nbsp;from a destructive strip-club raid to a murder scene where his two leading lawmen enjoy cheeseburgers over a fresh corpse.&nbsp;McDonagh bathes in the tears of politically correct watchdogs, and deals out riotous verbal lashings with fearless equality, just as a confident humorist should. <strong>War On Everyone</strong> isn’t the filmmaker’s tightest work, but it’s still seething&nbsp;with take-no-prisoners comedy, and a mean-streak that any&nbsp;McDonagh fan with absolutely adore.</p><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star-half></span><span class=icon-star-empty></span><h5 class=review-rating>Good</h5><p class=review-summary>War On Everyone is a pitch-black, nihilistic riot, like a pissed-off teenager spinning atop a mountain with two outstretched middle fingers pointing in every direction.</p><p class=review-title>War On Everyone Review [SXSW 2016]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorpqqXaS7brHVnqmyp56aerOx1aKcsGWjrcC4eZFpaG9n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
