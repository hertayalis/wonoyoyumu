They were often seen alongside one another at most events.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Von's sister Kayla shared a video of a new tattoo she got in honor of her late brother. It's a portrait of her<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> brother's face</a> on her&nbsp;leg but it didn't receive the type of reception you'd expect. She was immediately trolled over the new piece but it was Sukihana who may have taken it too far. In a comment on IG, Sukihana flamed the tattoo, claiming the tattoo looks like a portrait of one of the members of the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ying Yang Twins</a>.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Kayla ultimately caught wind of the comments and fired back at Sukihana, though she didn't seem concerned about the matter. She did, however,&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">plant the seed for a potential fight.</a> "Find you something 2 do before I put a date on it," she wrote. Suki was down for the challenge. She aired out a Kayla B on IG with a challenge to actually square up for a $30K prize. "I feel like what's credible -- 'cause none of the shit y'all doing is credible. What's credible is gettin' in that ring. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">You got smoke with that hoe</a>? You feel like I disrespected you? Bitch, get in that ring," Sukihana said. At the end of the day, Suki is all about a dollar and she said that she would rather duke it out than be miserable over the internet.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Get money hoes, we don't do that. We get money," she continued. "I'mma challenge you to get in that ring with me and I got, not ten, not 20, but 30&nbsp;bands, you feel me? Come get this money.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">No word no whether this fight has been picked up but we can't say this wouldn't be an interesting match-up.
