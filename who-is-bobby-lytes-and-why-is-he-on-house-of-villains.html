We root for the wholesome, clever, and kind contestants while watching our favorite shows, but it’s the villains — the rude, cruel, and hated contestants — that make the best television. I never expected to see Shake from Love Is Blind‘s second season again, after the tongue-lashing he received from nearly every other member of the cast — and one of its hosts — but his involvement in House of Villains guarantees that I’ll watch. The same can be said for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">every cast member on the show</a> — yes, she’s that Omarosa — and viewers are already lining up to watch those reality stars we love to hate compete for the title of America’s Favorite Supervillain, along with a $200,000 cash prize.</p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=299 data-injectable=false>A number of reality favorites are joining Shake and host Joel McHale for the show’s debut season, coming from a range of programs. Love & Hip Hop‘s <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bobby Lytes</a></strong> is among the lineup, but those unfamiliar with his first reality stint may be unaware of how he earned a spot on the show.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-bobby-lytes data-injectable=false>Who is Bobby Lytes?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bobby_Lytes.jpg><p data-characters=581 data-current-count=581 data-injectable=true>Bobby Lytes is a 32-year-old Florida native with a background in rap. He joined the cast of Love & Hip Hop: Miami in its debut season and has persisted as a main cast member through the majority of the series’ run. Fans of Love & Hip Hop: Miami have watched for years as Lytes, an openly gay man, fought against the often homophobic rap community in hopes of making a name for himself. Across the reality show’s five seasons, his role has gradually diminished, thanks in large part to the same behavior that earned him a spot among the House of Villains lineup.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Why is Bobby Lytes on House of Villains?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=506 data-current-count=806 data-injectable=false>Lytes, like the rest of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">House of Villains competitors</a>, earned a spot on the show after making waves — and not in a good way — in another reality program. For Lytes, it was Love & Hip Hop: Miami, where he’s known to frequently clash with his fellow cast members. His season one break-up, following feud, and complicated relationship with several of his on-screen peers made him an easy antagonist for fans of the Florida-based series, and it makes him a perfect fit for House of Villains.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmmp%2BXr7p5y7KrnqtdlruledahsGaho2K1pnnOp2Shp6Wosm67xWatoqSclravv44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
