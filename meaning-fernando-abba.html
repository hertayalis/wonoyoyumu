The Swedish-language version of the song, which was the original version, has lyrics that deal with love. It is basically about a man named Fernando who has lost his love and is being consoled by the singer. According to Björn Ulvaeus of ABBA, he wasn’t too impressed with that love theme of the lyrics of the Swedish version of Fernando since he found it too “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">banal</a>”. Owing to this, he decided to change it into something more profound, hence the birth of the very moving story of the two freedom fighters reminiscing about the war they participated in when they were young.</p><p>The lyrics of the Spanish language version of Fernando have the same meaning as the lyrics of the English language version of the song. The only difference is that the lyrics are in Spanish.</p><p><a href=#><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.songmeaningsandfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Fernando.jpg alt="Fernando lyrics" width=442 height=207 data-sizes="(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p>');var c=function(){cf.showAsyncAd(opts)};if(typeof window.cf !== 'undefined')c();else{cf_async=!0;var r=document.createElement("script"),s=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];r.async=!0;r.src="//srv.tunefindforfans.com/fruits/apricots.js";r.readyState?r.onreadystatechange=function(){if("loaded"==r.readyState||"complete"==r.readyState)r.onreadystatechange=null,c()}:r.onload=c;s.parentNode.insertBefore(r,s)}; })();<h3>Facts about “Fernando”</h3><ul><li>Fernando was written by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus of ABBA and the group’s manager Stig Anderson.</li><li>Stig Anderson wrote the lyrics of the Swedish language version of the song.</li><li>Benny and Björn handled the production of the song.</li><li>The working title of the song was Tango.</li><li>The name “Fernando”, which eventually became the title of the song, was given to the band by Peter Forbes who worked as their driver.</li><li>Fernando sold over 10 million copies across the globe, making it one of the most successful singles in the entire history of music.
