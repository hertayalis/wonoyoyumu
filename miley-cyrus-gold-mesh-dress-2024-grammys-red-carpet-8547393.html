Tonight, the superstar singer is here to get her flowers, figuratively, at the 2024 Grammy Awards. Cyrus and her latest album, Endless Summer Vacation, earned six nominations this year: Album of the Year; Pop Duo/Group Performance for "Thousand Miles," her duet with Brandi Carlile; Song of the Year for "Flowers"; Record of the Year; Best Pop Vocal Album; and Best Pop Solo Performance. Though she hasn't won any Grammy Awards just yet, her album BANGERZ was up for multiple awards in 2015.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And while we all wait to see which trophies she ends up taking home, she made her grand entrance at Los Angeles's Crypto.com Arena wearing a shipwreck-chic gold metal custom dress by Maison Margiela that was inspired by a John Galliano Fall-Winter 1996 look. Rather than a gown, Miley opted for a micro-mini silhouette that featured mesh netting, an intricately beaded neckline, and sculptural safety-pin detailing at the bust.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Underneath, she wore a matching pair of metal panties and accessorized with a pair of controversial gold velvet Tabi heels. As for glam, Miley wore her hair in big country-star curls that would make godmother Dolly Parton proud, and finished things off with a nude lip and bronze eyeshadow.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>David Crotty/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The last time Cyrus attended the show was back in 2019, when she walked the red carpet with her parents, Billy Ray Cyrus and Tish Cyrus. She took the stage that night, performing "In&nbsp;My&nbsp;Blood" with Shawn Mendes. Ahead of the duet, Cyrus teased the performance on&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a>, where eagle-eyed fans spotted Mendes's guitar in the background of one of her shots. It wasn't their only performance that week. Prior to the Grammys, they teamed up at the MusiCares Dolly Parton tribute show.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I actually sent him a DM and said, ‘I don’t know what you’re trying to do next,’ because I’ve actually been in his position in his career, too, before, where you’re someone who I think is trying to fit into pop music and you want to be played on pop music, but you don’t want to be conformist and you want to do your own thing,” Cyrus told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Variety</a> after the performance. “I love the way that he always kind of plays alternative pop, because it’s something that I love to do.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>More in Celeb News</span></h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zKKjnrFdmMazwdJmnqiklGK6pr%2FHZpurnaOoenN8kW1koKqRorq6v4yrnJ1lk5a%2FsbHTZm9ubGdohnQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
