The streaming service provider isn’t making it up, though. Child, in real life, was a big fan of some spicier language, albeit used sparingly.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>HBO Max’s ‘Julia’ is based on the life of Julia Child&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-3_73>At the end of March, HBO Max launched yet another original project.&nbsp;Julia, a limited series, follows the life of famed chef and television personality Julia Child. The goal of the series is to take viewers on a journey through <a href=#>Child’s early years </a>on television, showing how she fought to become the cooking icon she was in her later life and even after her death. Child’s story is dramatic, extraordinary, and fascinating as is.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Julia-Child-3.jpg><p id=par-4_64>Still, some creative license has been taken to move the storyline along. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Washington Post</a>, Chris Keyser and Daniel Goldfarb, the series’ showrunner and creator, did take some creative liberties. For example, the publication explained that an encounter between Julia Child and feminist author, Betty Friedan, didn’t happen. Other aspects of the show, like Child’s descriptive and colorful language choices, were 100% accurate.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The famed chef used some colorful language to describe her own cooking&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-5_49>Sarah Lancashire, the actor who portrays Julia Child, spent a fair bit of time researching the character. Still, some fans of the French chef found the character’s use of colorful language and sexual innuendo a bit unsettling. After all, that’s now how they know Child from her cooking show.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/sarah-lancashire.jpg><p id=par-6_76>That part of Lancashire’s portrayal of Julia Child is completely accurate. According to her biographer, Noël Riley Fitch, Child was not shy about sexual matters and used colorful language. In his book,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Appetite for Life: The Biography of Julia Child</a>, Fitch also suggested that the rumored spy was a big fan of gossip. One of Fitch’s stories, in which Child referred to cannelloni as “hotter than a stiff c—!”, made it into the 2009 film&nbsp;Julie & Julia.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-julia-child-still-wasn-t-crazy-about-julie-powell>Julia Child still wasn’t crazy about Julie Powell&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-7_62>Julia isn’t the first fictionalized version of Child’s life. The 2009 film&nbsp;<a href=#>Julie and Julia&nbsp;</a>was based on the story of Julie Powell cooking her way through&nbsp;Mastering the Art of French Cooking. Powell documented the process on her blog. That blog was then turned into the flick. In the film, Julie, played by Amy Adams, laments that her cooking hero, Julia Child, hates her.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_67>The movie injected drama where there really wasn’t any. Child didn’t hate Powell. She wasn’t all that crazy about her approach to cooking, though. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mashed</a>, Child was incredibly humble and had little need for technology by the time Powell came along. She didn’t even know what a blog was. Still, When pressed about Powell, Child reportedly said, “Well, she just doesn’t seem very serious, does she?”</p><p id=par-9_34>Judith Jones, the editor partially responsible for bringing Child’s cookbook stateside, noted that neither she nor Julia found Powell’s excessive use of expletives while cooking attractive. The key term seems to be “while cooking.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Judith-Jones.jpg><p id=par-10_37>Sadly, neither Jones nor Child can offer their thoughts on HBO Max’s take on the extraordinary life of Julia Child. Child died in 2004 at the age of 92. Judith Jones died in 2017. She was 93.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS1o7uMppixq12fwq21wGagrKakYrOqrsGipaBlmqq5qq2MnJ%2BipJRisLa%2B0p5loaydoXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
