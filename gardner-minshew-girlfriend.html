Minshew shares the same parents with his two sisters; &nbsp;Callie&nbsp;Minshew&nbsp;and Meredith&nbsp;Minshew.</p><p>Minshew stands at a height of 1.85 m and he weighs 102kg. When Minshew played flag football in the seventh grade, he and his father adapted Mike Leach’s air raid offense.</p><p>In the process, he developed a close relationship with Wyatt Rogers, the local coach who first showed him how to use that style of play. Rogers was the father of Minshew’s mentor, Will Rogers, a future quarterback for college football.</p><p>As the starting quarterback for the all-freshman team until varsity quarterback Trey Polk fractured his arm midway through the season, Minshew started playing football for Brandon High School in 2011.</p><p><a href=#>Minshew </a>assisted the Brandon Bulldogs in their journey to the MHSAA 6A title game the following year, where they fell to South Panola 31-23. In the championship game, Minshew had 223 throwing yards and one touchdown.</p><p>As a senior in 2014, he led the Bulldogs to an MHSAA state title victory with 3,541 passing yards and 31 touchdowns en route to the championship game.</p><p>Minshew had a.588 completion percentage, 9,705 passing yards, 88 passing touchdowns, 1,417 running yards, 17 rushing touchdowns, and just 24 interceptions in four years of high school football. He received two stars from 247Sports.com and three stars from Rivals.com as a recruit.</p><p>After being selected, Minshew competed with Tanner Lee and Alex McGough during the Jaguars’ training camp for a chance to assist starting quarterback Nick Foles. When Lee and McGough were released in August, Minshew was given the job despite a lackluster preseason, with the understanding that Foles would get the majority of the starts.</p><p>To make his NFL debut, <a href=#>Minshew </a>took over when Foles suffered a left clavicle fracture in the first quarter of Week 1’s game against the Kansas City Chiefs. He completed 22 of 25 passes for 275 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception in the 40-26 defeat.</p><p>Since at least 1979, no quarterback has completed 13 consecutive throws. Minshew also had the greatest pass completion percentage of any rookie in the NFL with at least 15 attempts, at 88 percent.</p><p>By the time Foles was activated off the injured reserve to reclaim the starting quarterback position on November 5, Minshew had a 4-4 record, 2,285 yards, 13 touchdown passes, four interceptions, and a 92.8 passer rating.</p><p>Minshew was given the opportunity to take over as the starting quarterback for the 2020 season when Foles was traded to the Chicago Bears in March 2020 in exchange for a fourth-round pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. As Minshew’s new backup, Joshua Dobbs was acquired from the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p><p>Minshew became the first NFL quarterback to throw for three or more touchdowns with a pass completion rate of 95 percent or higher when defeating the Indianapolis Colts 27-20 in the opening game of the season. Minshew completed 19 of 20 pass attempts for 173 yards and three touchdowns.</p><p>Minshew sustained several fractures and a torn ligament in his right thumb during a defeat to the Houston Texans on October 11; despite these injuries, he played through until Jacksonville’s 39-29 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers on October 25. In that game, he threw for 301 yards and two touchdowns.</p><p>In exchange for a conditional sixth-round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, the Jaguars traded Minshew to the Philadelphia Eagles on August 28, 2021. The Eagles then released quarterback Nick Mullens.</p><p>In Week 13, Minshew made his first start of the 2021 campaign when Jalen Hurts, the team’s regular quarterback, missed time with an ankle injury. <a href=#>Minshew</a> led the Eagles to a 33-18 victory over the New York Jets by completing 20 of 25 passes for 242 yards and two scores.</p><p>Hurts had the chance to rest before the start of the 2021–22 NFL playoffs when Minshew was asked to start once more in the Eagles’ regular-season finale against the Dallas Cowboys.</p><p>Hurts’ backup&nbsp;quarterback Minshew started the 2022 campaign. In Week 8 of the current campaign, he replaced Hurts for the final ten minutes of the Eagles’ 35-13 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p><p>In his brief game, he had a 1-for-2 shooting percentage and 23 yards. At the conclusion of the Eagles’ Week 13 contest against the Tennessee Titans, Minshew made another appearance. He had a 1-for-2 performance for 11 yards, and Philadelphia won 35-10.</p><p>Minshew was named the Eagles’ starting quarterback for their game against the Dallas Cowboys on Christmas Eve after Hurts sustained a right shoulder sprain during Week 14’s contest against the Chicago Bears.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Gardner Minshew dating?</h2><p>Most of <a href=#>Minshew’s</a> fans seem to be very concerned about his relationship status. However, it appears that the 26 year old sports sensation is not in a relationship at the moment.</p><p>Even if he is in a relationship, he has been very tight lipped about his relationship and perhaps wants to take his time before making it publoic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqCYq5yemr9uucinqqGdp2K0qr7Ln6minZ6ZfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
