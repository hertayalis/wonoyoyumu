It is an incredibly bold statement although Levario does a great job with the lettering and the shading. In a report from TMZ, it was revealed that the tattoo took three hours from start to finish.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Levario has done leg sleeves for Davis in the past, and we're sure these two will continue to work together moving forward. You can check out the new tattoo, as well as some of Levario's other work, in the posts below.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Alexander Cole is the current Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop.
