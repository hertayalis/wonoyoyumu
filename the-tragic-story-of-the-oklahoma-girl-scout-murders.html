In addition, police were able to take DNA samples from the scene (via <a href=#>Forensic Tales</a>). When investigators spoke to camp counselors, they were informed that only two months before the triple-homicide, a distressing event had occurred. <a href=#>Ranker</a> writes that during training, one counselor's tent had been rifled through and a note had been left. It stated, "We are on a mission to kill three girls in tent one." This was thought to be a cruel joke and it was disregarded.</p><p dir=ltr>As for the three girls, <a href=#>The Mystery Box</a> explains that Guse and Farmer had been more than excited to attend the camp. Milner, however, was having second thoughts and high levels of anxiety about leaving home. She decided against going but ultimately, her mother convinced her to attend. With all the physical evidence and claims of strange noises throughout the night, many believed the murders would be solved without a hitch, but this was not the case.</p><p dir=ltr>Investigators, however, did have a suspect in mind: Gene Leroy Hart. Per <a href=#>All That's Interesting</a>, police dogs found a cave near the campsite that had items belonging to both the camp and to Hart. Moreover, someone had written, "The killer was here. Bye bye fools. 77-6-17" on another cave nearby. Only four years earlier, the convict had broken out of prison and had been on the run ever since.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCEj2xva3BfqbWmedOrmKChk2LAtbvRsmSonl2ptaZ5zqSjmqCfoq5us8iro2ark6TCtXnMrqmdnaKofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
