Given the the former is the name that is currently trending, opinion is tending to skew in favor of the revolver-equipped Sheriff-turned-survivor over the closed-off and bereaved father:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=637 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>anyways rick grimes will always be THE zombie apocalypse man it’s true it’s true <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/w2wcJAT2sd</a></p>— hiyori will have a happy ending everyone shut up (@hiyorikins) <a href=#>April 25, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>i say this with no exaggeration but andrew lincoln gives a better performance in his first 5 minutes as rick grimes than pedro pascal did in the entire tlou show <a href=#>https://t.co/xyMlIXE6xc</a></p>— b e a n (@atdapyramid) <a href=#>April 25, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Rick Grimes over Joel all day long<a href=#>#TheWalkingDead</a> <a href=#>#TheLastOfUsHBO</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/0CWwisaH7m</a></p>— MoviesThatMaher (@MoviesThatMaher) <a href=#>April 25, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=304 data-injectable=false>While Lincoln’s Rick appears to be the G.O.A.T apocalypse survivor in the eyes of many, Pascal’s Joel wasn’t without his own staunch supporters, arguing that The Last of Us star managed to pull of just as much character development in the span of nine episodes as Lincoln did in nine seasons:&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=604 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>you’re mad bc pedro did in 9 episodes what that man couldnt do in 11 seasons <a href=#>https://t.co/1tlmOfyCoG</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Bbi1trpwsU</a></p>— anahí (@tyunswt) <a href=#>April 25, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>Others, meanwhile, were just straight-up exasperated by the debate, and are of the mind that comparing the pair is like comparing apples to oranges.
