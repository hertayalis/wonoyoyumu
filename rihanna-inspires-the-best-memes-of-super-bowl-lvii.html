Mahomes was hurt, and fans were wondering if it was going to take him out of the game. He held strong and faced his opponents in the second half with a drive in the third quarter that set the stage. It let the Eagles know that the game was still in pursuit, and it was up to anyone to grab.</p><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=367 data-injectable=false>In the meantime, Rihanna offered a brilliant halftime show that stunned the crowd. There were <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">celebrities in the audience who had shown up to the biggest game</a> in the football season to witness just her performance.

If they only knew what it took to put a halftime show together that was going to be tested against Prince, Michael Jackson. The Rolling Stones, and Lady Gaga, they might pause for a moment and give her a few stars for creativity and all the rest of the stones for nailing the halftime show.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Lol man I had the same thought about that looking like an original Mario level.</p><p>My wife‚Äôs reaction: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/6zkzkYLxP2</a></p>‚Äî zeezy (@drfunk387) <a href=#>February 13, 2023</a><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=261 data-injectable=false>While the Chiefs are now celebrating another ring under Mahome‚Äôs leadership, Rihanna can stand proud knowing she delivered a great halftime performance.
