The former spouses had Julez when the singer was only 18. They married in February 2004, just months before Julez was born. His birthday is on October 18, 2004.</p><p class=dh>Solange and Daniel stayed married for only three years. It came to a point that Solange <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://pagesix.com/2017/02/10/solange-relocating-for-ex-was-bittersweet/>felt isolated and alone</a>. She had been solely taking care of Julez when they moved to Idaho with Daniel who attended school there. Solange’s career took a backseat at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/819af1c7f442be17899c5f28cbdc26d7.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Solange Knowles and her son, Julez Smith attending an event in May 2014. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>THEIR FRIENDLY ARRANGEMENT</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>Though their marriage didn’t prosper, Solange and Daniel managed to become friendly co-parents.</p><p class=dh>“We co-parent really well. I’m able to say, ‘I need to finish this album, can you step up and take care of the boy?'” Solange <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/news/a1835/solange-knowles-0414/>said</a> in 2014 in an interview with Harper’s Bazaar.</p><p class=dh>Though Julez grew up mostly with his mother, Daniel constantly sees him. Father and son would often bond as evident in Daniel’s social media feeds.</p><p class=dh>Meanwhile, Solange, who recently split from her husband, <a class="me a" href=#>Alan Ferguson</a>, is a hands-on mother who makes Julez her number one priority. She uprooted from Brooklyn to New Orleans to ensure her son kept a stable set of friends and environment.</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>MORE ON JULEZ</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>Julez has already been showing interest in venturing into music like his mother but Solange is hesitant. If she had her way, she’d want him to be a diplomat.</p><p class=dh>This may also be the reason why she encouraged him to learn French. She told a fan who inquired about <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.essence.com/celebrity/solange-responds-fan-who-questions-why-her-son-speaks-french/>Julez’s fluency in the language</a> that it would help him connect with people when he travels to Africa.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpwcW9kanq0u8uapaCdXaC7sMPLnqpmq5%2Bjeqmt0maeq6eno3qieceapZ2rn6Kyb7TTpqM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
