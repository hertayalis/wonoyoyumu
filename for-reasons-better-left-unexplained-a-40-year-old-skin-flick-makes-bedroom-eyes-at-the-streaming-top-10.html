However, things have been raised to an entirely new level now that <strong>Love Scenes </strong>has made the most unexpected return to relevance.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=376 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>The 1984 skin flick that initially aired on the Playboy Channel in the United States and is quite literally marketed as softcore pornography has ended up as one of the Top 10 most-watched features on Vudu among Stateside audiences, per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FlixPatrol</a>. Why? Well, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">you can draw your own conclusions on that one</a>, but suffice to say it’s most definitely better left unexplained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/love-scenes-1-e1686986011148.jpg><p data-characters=450 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=true>There are actually a couple of recognizable names in the cast, though, with ex-Bond Girl Britt Ekland and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Adam West’s Catwoman Julie Newmar among them</a>, but that still isn’t enough justification as to why a saucy tale that was released almost 40 years ago has suddenly become must-see for a multitude of paying customers. Of course, it’s best not to think about it too much, otherwise you could end up being haunted by the rationale.</p><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=379 data-injectable=false>Not that anyone cares, but the storyline does attempt to put an artful twist on its subject matter, with a renowned actress taking on a risque role in a new film that’s being directed by her absent husband. However, she ends up going a little too method by indulging in an extramarital affair with her co-star, throwing both her marriage and the production onto the rocks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonaiqXaeyor%2FOp6pmmpWpwaa%2BjKWcn6xdqrumxM%2BlmKKmlZl6onmTaWSynZGnerC4w2aqpKGeYrOttcKkZKaZm5rAbq7Enamop51isrqx0maYrWWknbJuv9OrnJqlmaO0bsDOqWRqaF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
