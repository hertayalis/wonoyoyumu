It's a rare occurrence but fans love him either way.</p>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-dSnYFs eqMhYP">Sarah Walsh</a><p class="sc-hYRTcE cWmyoM">Feb. 19 2024, Published 9:08 a.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@gpalazz2</a></figure><p>52-year-old <a href=#>Gino Palazzolo</a>, of <a href=#>90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days,</a> and his fiancée <a href=#>Jasmine</a> have had their fair share of ups and downs. Whether they are throwing lip glosses in fits of rage or kissing passionately and confessing their love for one another, one thing is constant — Gino is always rocking his signature look, which often includes a baseball cap or a fedora. However, fans occasionally get a glimpse of him without a hat on, which is a rare site for fans of the show.</p><p>In the early years of their relationship, Jasmine would press Gino about taking off his hat, because she rarely saw him without something covering his head. On the topic, Gino told producers, “Jasmine knows about my hair and stuff, or the hair I don’t have. But…I always have my hat because I prefer how I look with the hat on.” Keep reading for all of the details on why he wears a hat and to see glimpses of him without a hat on.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Gino’s hats make him feel more comfortable with his scalp psoriasis.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@gpalazz2</a></figure><p>You probably remember the episode where Jasmine tried to get Gino to take his hat off the day he met her mom for the first time.</p><p>Despite Jasmine's insistence, Gino declined to remove his hat, expressing feelings of anxiety and discomfort. She told producers, “Come on, you’re gonna be meeting my mother, just take off the f--king hat. That’s silly to me. But Gino is so delicate when you talk about his hat, Jesus Christ.”</p><p>Later Jasmine learned that Gino was doing more than covering a receding hairline. He was also making himself more comfortable because of his scalp psoriasis. After learning this, she took to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> to tell fans that Gino had a chronic skin disease that causes red, itchy, scaly patches. She told fans to be kind, by saying, “You never know the struggles people are facing, choose to be kind.”</p><p>But now that Jasmine knows the real reasons he wears his hats, she is much more compassionate and understanding of his fashion choices. Ever since a photo surfaced of Gino without a hat walking through the airport, he has posted a few older photos of what he looked like years ago — and of course, many of the photos show Gino without a hat!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Gino posted a Polaroid of himself at 21 years old!</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Gino Palazzolo (@gpalazz2)</a></p></figure><p>Gino posted a Polaroid of himself at 21 years old! He was feeling pretty nostalgic about this one, saying "I know it’s hard to believe but this is me with full head of hair AND NO HAT a few moons ago. 😹🙀🤪 I was 21 years young in this photo. Another throwback 🎉🤪."</p><p>The post garnered almost 3,000 likes, and fans reacted with such excitement. One fan said, "😍😍😍😍OMG you were sooooo sexyyyyy 👍🏾💯."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Gino also posted a hatless picture from his Dad's wedding.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Gino Palazzolo (@gpalazz2)</a></p></figure><p>This was another nostalgic post for Gino. He was 24 years old, and he stood with his family to celebrate his father's wedding. Gino is on the far left of the photo, and he is rocking super '90s dress pants and an oversized button-up shirt.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Gino also posed without a hat at Madame Tussauds in London.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Gino Palazzolo (@gpalazz2)</a></p></figure><p>In this photo, which seems to have been taken in the early 2000s, Gino posed next to a wax replica of <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>. The craziest part of the photo is that it was taken at the Madame Tussauds Wax Museum in London!</p><p>So many fans came to the comments to let Gino know that he looks great with or without his hat. And for the record, Jasmine likes Gino’s bald look.</p><p>She told producers, “The very brief times I have seen him without the hat, I’m telling him like, ‘You are [the] Michigan version of Bruce Willis.’ Like, look at him! He’s a Hollywood star.”</p><p>Even though we many not see too many more pictures of Gino without his hat, we think he looks great either way too!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnLavu4ywoK2gn6rBbq2MoZitZWlleqWt2GadopmemLI%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
