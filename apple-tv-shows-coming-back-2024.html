From Bad Sisters to Trying, here’s what’s back in 2024…&nbsp;</p><h3>Severance season 2&nbsp;</h3><p id=enGLuBZ30P2 data-wc=74>After perhaps the best season finale ever, we can’t wait to get more answers (and let’s face it, probably be offered up plenty of new mysteries) in Adam Scott’s deeply weird but addictive TV show about office workers who have a microchip in their brains which means they forget about their personal lives while working, and forget their work lives in reality - leading them to be two very different people. Bring it on.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Severance season two is back in 2024</figure><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>WATCH APPLE TV+ HERE</p></a><h3>Slow Horses season 4&nbsp;</h3><p id=enk1VoBxkyG data-wc=41>Slow Horses is one of telly’s most underrated shows - with the tale of MI5 agents at Slough House reaching its peak in season three. Here’s what the novel’s description has to say about what we might expect from season four.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2b445cd45883-slowhorsesphoto030301.jpg><p id=euFtsHbieBYM data-wc=80>It read: “Retired from the intelligence service, David Cartwright still knows where the skeletons are hidden. But when he forgets that secrets are supposed to stay buried, there's suddenly a target on his back… Jackson Lamb worked with David back in the day. He knows better than most that this is no innocent old man. So when River's panic button raises the alarm at Intelligence Service HQ, Lamb will do whatever he thinks necessary to protect an agent in peril.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/280b7d50fc7b-slowhorsesphoto030203.jpg><h3>Trying season 4</h3><p id=e2bZUPDEuxqu data-wc=49>Now that Jason and Nikki have landed custody of their kids Princess and Tyler, the challenge is keeping their family together! With plenty more humour and drama, we can’t wait to see what comes next for our favourite television couple, their friends and parents, and their new little family.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9ca403dbf609-trying-rafe-t.jpg><h3>Mythic Quest season 4&nbsp;</h3><p id=eoUuvkJ3w4KM data-wc=32>Mythic quest, despite the name, is much less about the RPG fantasy game being made and much more about the dysfunctional work environment and the relationships between the talented but neurotic characters.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8d99e0d56c07-gettyimages-1440416221.jpg><p id=edRQKTdePOK5 data-wc=60>Season 3 left off with Ian (pronounced Iron) and Poppy returning to Mythic Quest following the previous seasons' walkout, reuniting with their anxiety-plagued former boss David. Meanwhile, Dana brings the evil and former frenemy pairing of Jo and Brad to start a new company. This hilarious stand-out is back for season 4 for a reason - so catch up now!&nbsp;</p><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>WATCH APPLE TV+ HERE</p></a><h3>Bad Sisters season 2&nbsp;</h3><p id=eeRVxuUTRhsI data-wc=64>Since season one - where the sisters went out of their way to kill their despised brother-in-law - was a pretty open-and-cut show, we’re curious to see where the story will go for this Irish drama’s second outing, but in Sharon Horgan we trust!
