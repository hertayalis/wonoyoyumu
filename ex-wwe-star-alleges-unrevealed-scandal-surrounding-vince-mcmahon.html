This legal battle was not the first and is unlikely to be the last. In fact, an ex-WWE star claimed that there are worse scandals about McMahon that haven’t been out yet.</p><p><a href=#>Vince McMahon is currently accused of sexual trafficking and misconduct</a>&nbsp;by ex-WWE employee Janel Grant. She alleges McMahon distributed explicit content of her without consent, involving other WWE personnel, undisclosed executives, and wrestling stars in her lawsuit.</p><p>Vince McMahon was previously accused of sexual assault by former WWE referee Rita Chatterton, who accused him of the act back in 1992. Things did not end just there either. In November 2022, McMahon’s attorney received a letter from Chatterton,&nbsp;<a href=#>in which she demanded $11.75 million in compensation for the alleged assault</a>, after her allegations were brought back to the public’s attention in 2022.</p><p>Mario Mancini was a WWE wrestler between 1984 and 1992. While speaking on the&nbsp;Cheap Heat Productions Podcast, Mancini claimed that “worse stuff” about McMahon was still not known to the public.</p><p>“He allegedly defecated on her head, and you saw those texts in the lawsuit. There’s worse stuff than that. I’m just waiting for one of them [stories] to come out. Rita and I were waiting last year.”</p><p>McMahon also had a <a href=#>multi-million dollar settlement</a> with Rita Chatterton. <a href=#>Vince McMahon also has no path back to WWE following his trafficking lawsuit</a>.&nbsp;<a href=#>WWE is taking steps to remove Vince McMahon from the WWE 2K24 video game</a>, indicating a clear effort to disassociate itself from his image. We will have to see what will become of McMahon when all is said and done.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What do you think of this story concerning Vince McMahon?
