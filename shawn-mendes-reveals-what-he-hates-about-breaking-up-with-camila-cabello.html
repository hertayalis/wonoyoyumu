Mendes said that the main thing that has really hit him since parting ways from Cabello is that he has to deal with these tough situations alone.&nbsp;"Now, I feel like, finally, I'm actually on my own, and I hate that," he said.</p><p>While the emotional aspect of the breakup has been hard, it appears both Mendes and Cabello are living busy professional lives as single celebs.&nbsp;While Cabello is gearing up for the release of her upcoming third studio album, <a href=#>"FAMILIA,"</a>&nbsp;Mendes performed a show-stopping concert in Austin, Texas on March 19, celebrating the "insane crowd"&nbsp;on <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcWhlZoV2e9KhmLCmXaKyr7DErGSrnaaarq2%2FjLCfmqxdnbJutMCtnKxlkZe8tsCMm6memZueu6h51KlksKGknXqkrcyio5plk5avprjLqGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
