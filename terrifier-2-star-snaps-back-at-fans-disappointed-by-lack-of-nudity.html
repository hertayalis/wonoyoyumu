She made this well-known by going on a Twitter rant about the topic.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=499 data-current-count=499 data-injectable=true>2016‚Äôs Terrifier featured very prominent and, rather distasteful, female nudity as Art the Clown tortured two women in one of the most shocking moments in the film. Thankfully, its sequel went away with the torture erotica angle of the first, although that creative decision hasn‚Äôt gone over well with everyone. Celebrating her movie‚Äôs release on video on demand, LaVera responded to one of the most insane bits of criticism the film may ever see: there wasn‚Äôt enough nudity.</p><h2 id=h-what-lauren-lavera-had-to-say-about-the-terrifier-2-criticisms data-injectable=false>What Lauren LaVera had to say about the Terrifier 2 criticisms</h2><p data-characters=461 data-current-count=461 data-injectable=true>Given the film‚Äôs premise follows a sadistic killer and the fact that its finished product resulted in audience members fainting and vomiting, this is a bizarre hill to die on. LaVera didn‚Äôt take this criticism lightly and called out a Twitter user at one point for wanting to see her on-screen character (a teenage girl) nude. She later deleted the tweet, even though it was a strong point to make. It should be noted LaVera herself is 28 years old.</p><p data-characters=127 data-current-count=127 data-injectable=false>When it got brought up later on, LaVera shared that she is not afraid of going topless but this film didn‚Äôt call for it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>The funny thing about all of this is that I ‚ú®have‚ú® been topless in a film before. I‚Äôm no stranger to it and I‚Äôm not afraid of it if it helps progress the story. It‚Äôs just T2 didn‚Äôt call for it, and yea, the character was underage. <a href=#>https://t.co/d6MijefB15</a></p>‚Äî Lauren LaVera (@_LaurenLaVera_) <a href=#>December 31, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=316 data-injectable=false>LaVera also pointed out the double standards of such a comment: there is some nudity in Terrifier 2 as a man‚Äôs penis gets brutalized in a vivid and disgusting way. The star feels some men just seem to get joy out of a woman getting brutalized on screen, and it has absolutely nothing to do with artistic value.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=616 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is such a good point. These dudes want to see naked women get brutalized and mask it as ‚Äúit‚Äôs just an artistic choice because it‚Äôs vulnerable‚Äù meanwhile the nudity in this film was from men and it wasn‚Äôt enough? A man‚Äôs penis was brutalized and that isn‚Äôt vulnerable enough? <a href=#>https://t.co/Mhl0BXWlHx</a></p>‚Äî Lauren LaVera (@_LaurenLaVera_) <a href=#>November 16, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>She later deleted several more tweets from the debate, citing it made her feel uncomfortable as it dragged on and saw more people get involved. There‚Äôs something interesting in how the world views female nudity in horror in particular, with horror often featuring scantily clad women getting horrible deaths, but why?</p><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=629 data-injectable=true>Is having a female star nude really crucial to a story or plot? In some films like Friday the 13th and X, there‚Äôs a definite subtext <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">around sex, promiscuity, and sexuality itself</a>. But not in Terrifier. The films follow a sadistic clown who kills on a whim, never because of anything related to sex.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>So I deleted some of the tweets concerning the nudity issue because some of the arguments I saw people getting into made me sad and as much as I love calling out creeps, I wanted to stop the arguments. Send me your wholesome pics/gifs/vids here. üåà</p>‚Äî Lauren LaVera (@_LaurenLaVera_) <a href=#>November 17, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=172 data-current-count=472 data-injectable=false>Credit to LaVera, who gave her absolute all in Terrifier 2 and is a star on the up. Looking to become a 2020s scream queen icon, she‚Äôll likely pop up in Terrifier 3.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TBpr7Rop2inaJif26%2F05qpZquelr20ecGamqRlkal6p63NrGSdoaOWvbG7yKernpxdl8ZuuMCcomanlmK7trDIrbBo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
